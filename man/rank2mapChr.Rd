\title{Map SNP positions to ranks within a genomic window}
\usage{
rank2mapChr(x, windowSize)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of sorted SNP positions.}

\item{windowSize}{The size of the genomic window in base pairs.}
}
\value{
A matrix with two columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{start}: The index of the leftmost SNP within the window.
\item \code{end}: The index of the rightmost SNP within the window.
}
}
\description{
Determines the start and end positions of SNPs within a sliding window along a chromosome.
Uses a two-pointer approach for efficiency.
