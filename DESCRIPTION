Description: Likelihood-based genome polarisation finds which alleles of genomic markers 
    belong to which side of the barrier. 
	Co-estimates which individuals belong to either side of the barrier and barrier strength.
	Uses expectation maximisation in likelihood framework. The method is described in 
	Baird et al. (2023) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.14010>.
